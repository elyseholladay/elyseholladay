Exploring impostor syndrome, the fine line between deceit and 'fake it til you make it,' and discovering ways we can be intentful about how we learn, challenge ourselves, and share our knowledge.

## Conferences

* Front End Design Conf · St. Petersburg, FL · July 11, 2014
* CSSConf Oakland · Oakland, CA · December 9, 2014
* Converge SE · Columbia, SC · April 16, 2015


## Overview

We've all felt compelled to say, "oh but I'm so bad at this," lest someone think we might have something valuable to say. We've all felt that surge of inspiration, followed by frustration, sometimes to the point of being unwilling to try again.

Why say you am not good at something? Doesn't being challenged matter? Is being good at something the only measure of its worth?

In this talk I explore how we learn, the fine line between deceit and "fake it til you make it," and discover some ways we can be intentful about how we learn, challenge ourselves, and share our knowledge.
